                 This workbook presents National Statistics on domestic (household) gas consumption by Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in Great Britain. This includes Data Zones (Scotland's equivalent of LSOAs). These estimates are weather-corrected. This means that the effect of differences in weather conditions between years has been removed to provide more like for like comparisons over time.

These figures are based on meter level gas consumption data provided by Xoserve (who compile meter level data from gas shippers, who in turn receive the data from gas suppliers). Xoserve provide annualised estimates of consumption (AQs) for all gas meters. Xoserve provide the AQs on a weather corrected basis by a process which accounts for regional temperatures and wind speed and incorporates trends.
                                          The gas meters are classified as being domestic or non-domestic according to their (weather-corrected) gas consumption. Those with an annual consumption less than the industry cut-off of 73,200 are classified as domestic and the rest are classified as non-domestic.  This means that some small industrial and commercial consumers will be classified as domestic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          - No domestic gas meters had postcodes which could be matched to the LSOA in question. This includes LSOAs which had no domestic properties\n  connected to the gas grid.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    - Any domestic gas meters matched to the given LSOA were re-allocated to the "Unallocated" row for disclosure control reasons (e.g. if there were fewer \n  than 5 meters matched to the LSOA).
