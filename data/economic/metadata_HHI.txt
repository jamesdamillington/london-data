              NaN                                    Regional level mean and median income data was calculated from ESRC Understanding Society dataset, wave 1-4 and British Household Panel Survey 2001-2008. All incomes below regional level are modelled. 
              NaN The small area data (sub-local authority level) has been modelled based on NS-SEC of people based on HRP (Census), Median house prices (land registry), Household deprivation (Census), Child Poverty Data (HMRC), and ONS income estimates.
              NaN        Each of these factors was turned into a score to make them directly comparable and then given a weighting as follows: NS-SEC (25%), House Prices (25%), Household deprivation (20%), Child Poverty (15%), and Income estimates (15%).

              NaN                                       Addititional data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings and the Survey of Personal Incomes, were used to increase reliability at borough level. Small adjustments were made based on this data.
