# London Data
Spatial data for London, curated for analysis using [ONS geographies](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies). Python code used to manipulate data from original sources is [provided](https://github.com/jamesdamillington/london-data/tree/main/code) (along with a [file](https://github.com/jamesdamillington/london-data/blob/main/code/environment.yml) specifying package requirements).

## Geographies
Boundary data for various geographies the UK ONS uses to produce statistics (e.g. census, electoral). Provided in `.shp` and `.csv` format, usually with [BNG CRS](https://epsg.io/27700).
